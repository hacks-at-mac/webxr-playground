# WebXR Playground

In today's meeting, we will be messing around with VR. This repository has been set up
with some basic code to get us up and running quickly. To get started, just clone this
repository and open up `index.html` in your browser. You're strongly encouraged to use
Firefox for this, since we require some new and experimental browser features that
aren't widely supported yet. It should also work in Chrome if you enable the WebVR
feature flag. For a complete list, here's a
[table of supported browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webvr).
